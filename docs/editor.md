# Values: Red IDE - editor component

## Installation

Editor is availbale in my Red fork, in the `editor` branch ([link](https://github.com/rebolek/red/tree/editor)).

### OSX

Checkout this branch and compile console.

### Windows

This branch cannot be compiled under Windows currently because it merged `MacOSX-GUI` branch, so you need to:

* Checkout qtxieâ€™s [Red console branch](https://github.com/qtxie/red/tree/red-console).
* Compile console.
* Checkout this branch.

## Running

* Open Red's console and run View console with
```
do %environment/red-console/red-console.red
```
* press `Escape` to enter editor.

## Usage

There are two editor modes: `insert` and `command`. Editor starts in `insert` mode. To enter command mode, press `Escape`. To go back to editor mode from command mode, press `a` for append or `i` for insert (see below).
